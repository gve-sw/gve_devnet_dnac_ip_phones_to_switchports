# 2.) Run `pwd` and `which python3` to get absolute paths to script files and python binary
# 3.) Run `crontab -e` (this will open VIM editor)
# 4.) Press `i`, then copy command above (subbing in the absolute paths you found earlier)
# 5.) Press `esc` key, then enter `:wq` to save

# NOTE: if no log file appears after day, or if running on a mac, ensure proper permissions for cron are set.
